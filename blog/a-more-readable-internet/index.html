I set a goal: make my site readable to the people who are curious enough to inspect its source code. I think I succeeded. But things have not turned out to be as simple as I'd hoped.</p><h2>The Complicated Web</h2><p>One part of working in SEO is knowing how to analyze and repair the foundations of struggling websites. For a large e-commerce site with thousands of pages, that task can be as difficult as repairing the physical foundation of a sprawling brick-and-mortar supermarket. Bug fixes and style revisions and new initiatives cause rapid expansion—the kind that can leave wires tangled and cause problems later on when further expansion is required.</p><p>That on-the-fly expansion is hard to avoid. You can't anticipate everything when you begin writing your site. This, though, is the reason for the impenetrable wall of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags and lines of CSS that often greets explorers who inspect the source of a webpage. That's not readable.</p><h2>My Goal</h2><p>I wanted my website to be as readable as possible when a visitor presses ⌘ + alt + U in their browser. I wanted them to see a neatly organized, easily recognizable poem of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>My goal was zero Javascript. Nothing but static HTML and CSS styling pulled from a separate, carefully organized file. (In this, I've succeeded.)</p><p>But I had to make the site responsive to screen size. So I added a couple of classes—<code>.desktop</code> and <code>.mobile</code> and sprinkled them all over the place. Though it worked, this off-the-cuff formatting quickly complicated my code. I decided to rebuild almost entirely, just a month after I'd set the site live.</p><p>A week and a half later, the site was rebuilt and beautifully organized. I felt clever and successful. I was ready to implement dark mode.</p><p>That, I discovered, is more difficult than simply duplicating every color property and adding a second version for <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>. Or, rather, it is exactly that difficult. Because that process is more than tedious: it's convoluted and inefficient and messy.</p><p>It was time to suck up my pride and abandon my goal of writing a website that looked like it had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991117024224/http://apple.com/">built in 1999</a>.</p><p>I added CSS variables.</p><h2>Variables Are for Programmers</h2><p>CSS variables are technically called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">custom properties</a>. They work like this: you define a variable for a specific property. I used a few (shown below) to store dark and light versions of the colors in my theme.</p><pre><code>     :root {
        --color-background-body: #f2f2f7;  
        --color-background-main: #ffffff;
        --color-text-default: #1c1c1e;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      :root {
        --color-background-body: #000000;
        --color-background-main: #1c1c1e;
        --color-text-default: #ffffff
      }
    }
</code></pre><p>I looked at what I'd done and felt… conflicted.</p><p>Would a regular (non-technical) visitor be happy to open my site's source code and see a list of variables? Would I, just a year ago, have understood what I was looking at?</p><p>Few. And not immediately.</p><p>But as far as I can tell, this is the simplest way of achieving the responsiveness that modern websites <em>must</em> prioritize. In fact, variables are much more readable than a sheet specifying the full hex values for every element of the site. That turns a CSS file into a cascade of <strong>#ff9500</strong> and <strong>rgb(155,220,255)</strong>.</p><h2>A Little Learning or a Lot of Nonsense</h2><p>CSS variables are not immediately readable for every person. But neither is HTML, in general. But upon closer inspection, you can get a general idea of what's happening with both. A custom property called <code>--color-text-default</code> is as semantically informative as an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag.</p><p>Where a sheet of hex numbers reads like a coded message, a list of variables reads like a glossary of terms placed at the beginning of the text. It makes reading everything that follows easier.</p><p>Of course, CSS custom properties are not a solution to the problems faced by enormous websites. But the principles behind these variables—efficiency and organization—are important for sites of every size. Whether you're a small business whose website is maintained by one or two employees or an individual doing it yourself, CSS variables can make maintenance, revisions and expansions much easier.</p><h2>Nothing to Hide</h2><p>You <em>can</em> build a modern website with simple, semantic code. It's a great way to be more transparent to users and make the jobs of future developers (and you) easier.</p><p>It's up to web developers to write with care and discipline. Developers: be the poets of the web, efficient and strict with syntax. Be the woodworkers who proudly brand their initials on the well-built frame of an upholstered chair. Few will see them. But those who do pull back the fabric to reveal the wood beneath will appreciate your craftsmanship.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/programming">programming</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><button><a href="mailto:ttwardzik@gmail.com">Contact</a></button></p><p>Copyright © 2020 Tom Twardzik</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ttwardz">Twitter</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-twardzik/">LinkedIn</a> <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01428f2b4067e07543/">Upwork</a> <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p>Written respectfully and from scratch in Swift.
