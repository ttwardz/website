</div><h2>Highlights from the Playlist</h2><h3>sounds like you had to be there - bar italia</h3><p>At bar italia's Bowery Ballroom concert in December 2023, I heard someone tell their friend, "You're about to hear the coolest band in the world. This is the last cool band." I laughed out loud at the declaration, but I at least partially agree—bar italia are very cool.</p><p>Their sound is grunge and punk but delicate and thoughtful, their attitude is careless but in the end happy, and their songs transport you to a place where you're dancing at a club but also comfortably at home, nodding your head to your favorite song while also nodding off while the lights come on at closing time.</p><p>"The steps you're taking are good / the choice you made is for you." It's reassuring and warm, and it's also just an incredible sound.</p><p>See also: "Nurse!"</p><h3>Knees Deep - The Beths</h3><p>The Beths are way too much fun. They're full of energy and songs that on the surface sound like the summer feels. But behind the catchy melodies, they surprise you with heavy riffs. Knees Deep has one of my favorite choruses, but it also has a guitar solo that <em>shreds</em>.</p><p>See also: "Silence Is Golden" and "A Real Thing"</p><h3>Vampire Empire - Big Thief</h3><p>This one you just have to hear. It turns quiet and wanting into a desperate, frustrated, belting passion. It's a love song where the refrain is "falling," over and over, and it's chaotic and unknown, as falling is. It'll make you sing and shout along every time.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/music">music</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><button><a href="mailto:ttwardzik@gmail.com">Contact</a></button></p><p>Copyright © 2020–2023 Tommy Twardzik</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ttwardz">Twitter</a> <a href="https://mstdn.social/@ttwardz">Mastodon</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-twardzik/">LinkedIn</a> <a href="/feed.rss">RSS</a></p><p>Written respectfully and from scratch in Swift.
