	<h3>December 9, 2019</h3>
	<p>I built this website using words. I set a goal: make my site readable to the people who are curious enough to inspect its source code. I think I succeeded. But things have not turned out to be as simple as I'd hoped.</p>

    	<h3>September 25, 2019</h3>
    	<p>That old quote about writing being as simple as sitting over a typewriter to bleed? Writing in a word processor feels more like sitting down at a table scattered with various styles of paper, pens, pencils and erasers and having to sort through it all to choose the right combination.</p>

<p>Plain text writing, on the other hand, feels like an empty desk with a pen and a notebook. Or a manual typewriter. Instead of clicking past a template selection window to tinker with line spacing and the right serif or sans-serif font, I can get to work.</p>

    	<h3>September 6, 2019</h3>
    	<p>Soccer was my favorite sport when I was young—elementary school age. I used to see it on TV as I browsed through channels and would watch a few minutes of those little men running across an enormous field of grass. I played in the local youth league but that was nothing like what I saw on TV. I could <em>see</em> the edges of the field on which I played. I was fast at that age and that was more important than any kind of skill on the ball. I loved playing soccer and I was pretty good.</p>
<p>I maintained to anyone who asked, however, that soccer was my favorite sport to <em>play</em> while football—NFL football—was my favorite sport to <em>watch</em>.</p>
