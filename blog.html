    	<h2><a href="/blog/messi">#10: For the Love of Football</a></h2>
    	<h3>September 6, 2019</h3>
    	<p>Soccer was my favorite sport when I was young—elementary school age. I used to see it on TV as I browsed through channels and would watch a few minutes of those little men running across an enormous field of grass. I played in the local youth league but that was nothing like what I saw on TV. I could <em>see</em> the edges of the field on which I played. I was fast at that age and that was more important than any kind of skill on the ball. I loved playing soccer and I was pretty good.</p>
<p>I maintained to anyone who asked, however, that soccer was my favorite sport to <em>play</em> while football—NFL football—was my favorite sport to <em>watch</em>.</p>
