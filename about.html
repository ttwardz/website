    <h1>About</h1>
    <!-- Shorten this first ¶ -->
    <p>I am a professional writer and content marketer who has spent over three years creating engaging, tailored digital content for the websites and social media accounts of a wide variety of companies. My writing and SEO work has increased clients’ organic sessions by as much as ten times and improved conversion rates by over 300%. My work for Amazon sellers increased revenue by as much as 30% and makes me uniquely qualified to write commerce-focused content.</p>

    <p>My work includes hundreds of articles that cover lifestyle, pop culture, finance and travel. I've produced content for pet food companies and international commodity exchanges. I've written tens of thousands of words on bugs. Blog posts, how-to guides, product comparisons, Amazon seller pages and product listings, ad copy, email newsletters, slideshows, ebooks…</p>

    <!-- class "grayBodyText" needs a white background. -->
    <p>Whatever content you need written, whatever story you need told, whatever product or service you need marketed, <span class="grayBodyText">I'm your writer.</span></p>
